Properly merge main branch to resolve GitHub conflict state

This creates a proper two-parent merge commit to resolve the GitHub
"dirty" mergeable_state. Previous commit b7b7e7d had the right file
contents but was not a true merge commit.

Conflicts resolved:
- components/HomeView.tsx: Keep enhanced implementation with toast notifications
- components/SocialView.tsx: Keep inline role badge
- lib/supabase.ts: Add role field while maintaining is_admin
