### 1\. The Gesture Map (The Core UX)

Everything revolves around the **Home Screen (The Card Stack)**.

| Gesture | Action | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Swipe Left** | **Skip** | Discards the current note. Shows the next card. |
| **Swipe Right** | **Save** | Adds note to your "Saved Collection." Shows the next card. |
| **Swipe Up** | **Go to Library** | Slides the screen up to reveal your Saved Notes/Search. |
| **Swipe Down** | **Go to Social** | Slides the screen down to reveal Leaderboard & Profile. |
| **Tap Center** | **Read/Unlock** | Expands the card to full screen for the "Scroll-to-Upvote" mechanic. |

### 2\. Structural Breakdown by Screen

#### **Center Screen: The Feed (Home)**

  * **Visual:** A large card stack in the middle.
  * **Content:** Algorithmically served notes (Followed users + Trending).
  * **The "Hook":** The card only shows the `Title`, `Author`, and `Summary`.
  * **Action:** Users decide in split seconds: Left (Boring), Right (Interesting), or Tap (I want to learn this now).

#### **Top Screen: The Library (Personal Knowledge)**

  * **Access:** Accessed by Swiping Up from Home.
  * **Content:**
      * **Search Bar:** To find specific concepts.
      * **Saved Stack:** A grid view of all the cards swiped "Right" on.
  * **Navigation:** Swipe Down to return to Home.

#### **Bottom Screen: The Hub (Social & Stats)**

  * **Access:** Accessed by Swiping Down from Home.
  * **Layout:** Two Tabs (Switchable by tapping or horizontal swipe).
      * **Tab A: Leaderboard:** Top 100 users ranked by "Upvotes" (Recall: Upvote = Someone scrolled to the bottom of their note).
      * **Tab B: Profile:** User's own stats, uploaded notes, and earnings/points.
  * **Navigation:** Swipe Up to return to Home.

### 3\. The "Reading Mode" Logic (Crucial Update)

*Since "Swipe Down" is now used for navigation, we need a slightly different trigger for the "Scroll-to-Upvote" feature you described earlier.*

1.  **The Trigger:** User **Taps** the card on the Home Stack.
2.  **The Transition:** The card expands to cover the full screen (like an Instagram Story or TikTok).
3.  **The Blur:** The bottom half is still blurred.
4.  **The Interaction:**
      * User scrolls down.
      * **Event:** `ScrollDepth > Threshold` triggers the **Unlock & Auto-Upvote**.
5.  **Exit:** User swipes the Expanded Note **Down** to close it and return to the stack.

### 4\. Visualizing the Flow

        [*] --> Search
        Search --> SavedGrid
    }

    state "HOME SCREEN (Stack)" as Home {
        state "Current Card" as Card
        Card --> NextCard : Swipe Left (Skip)
        Card --> NextCard : Swipe Right (Save)
        Card --> ReadMode : Tap Card
    }

    state "READING MODE" as ReadMode {
        state "Blurred View" as Blur
        Blur --> UnlockedView : Scroll Down (Auto-Upvote)
        UnlockedView --> Home : Swipe Down to Close
    }

    state "SOCIAL SCREEN" as Social {
        state "Leaderboard Tab" as Leader
        state "Profile Tab" as Profile
    }

    %% Navigation Connections
    Home --> Library : Swipe Up
    Library --> Home : Swipe Down

    Home --> Social : Swipe Down
    Social --> Home : Swipe Up
```

### 5\. Technical "Moat" Feature: The Pre-Fetch

To make this feel "addictive" and fluid, the app needs to feel instant.

  * **Logic:** When the user is on Card \#1, the app must strictly pre-load the content (images/text) for Card \#2 and \#3 in the background.
  * **Result:** No loading spinners when swiping. The next card is always ready.
